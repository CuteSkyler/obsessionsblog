                    	Today was just absolutely fucking dreadful. All this talk about gender, medication, sex, et cetera just keeps penetrating my mind, and finances too. Gender is just so penatrative in my mind. "Hey I just got this amazing thing for estrogen to make my body all feminine like, I'm so happy!". You probably read that and thought, "nothing wrong with that", I read that and think "Kill yourself. Grab the nearest knife and slit your wrists. Grab the tallest ladder, climb the tallest building and do a summersault over the edge." How do you think it makes a transgender feel that has been transgender for over 6 years and still has to wait one and a half times that just to go on a intake talk, a motherfucking talk, not even the medication, which I can even be disallowed from, just a talk, and you sit here on your high horse telling me you have it all figured out, so happily and joyful. I hear those words and I think you're a piece of shit, a disgusting cretin who crawled out of hell just to tell me the sense of "I beat you. I've only been transgender for three months and I beat you. Look at you, you pathetic no life, waiting for the right moment to talk to your general practicioner, Ms. Goodie Two-Shoes who takes it the legal route instead of buying drugs from a third party website, you can just BUY the estrogen, idiot, fucking stupid cunt. Why are you acting so negative, I'm super extatic but you're such a cunt that you don't even let me feel joy? What's wrong with you?".
                <br><br>
                    	Just seeing those two words, "36 months", on the mail I got from the medical centre, it just breaks my heart. I have probably gone through more triles and tribulations than most of those cunts that signed up for medication who will give up halfway though or sooner anyway because they "weren't feeling it" or some other dumb bullshit. So many fake transgenders in the world and then I have to suffer for it, all of these disgusting crossdressers, fetishists, babytrannies, it enrages me. Why do I have to suffer, WHY DO I HAVE TO SUFFER JUST BECAUSE THESE CUNTS HAVE THE MONEY, THE RUSH OR JUST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY "FELT LIKE IT". The government doesn't care, clearly, if they cared at all they would've sent more of those sweet, sweet taxes to the transgender medical department so that the waiting list wouldn't have to be this insufferably long, all those politicians say that they oh so care about those poor LGBT's and whatnot, even though they haven't done shit for those who are actually suffering and not the ones fetishising and parading it up in Amsterdam. Instead of putting money into policing that disgrace of human existence put it to where it actually matters? Into transgender treatment, free public transport, better education, just any of those would be fine, thank you.
                <br><br>
                    	My skin is just awful, it's falling off piece by piece. Excema everywhere on my body, everywhere it's just fucking excrushiatingly itchy, I've scratched myself open, my skin once nice is just being destroyed. I feel shame whenever I go outside, everywhere people look and think that I have some sort of disease, some incurable form of skin cancer. I don't want to go to anyone just because I just think they'll look at me and think I'm a disgusting trogledyte, even writing this my skin can not endure my fingers scratching off my skin layer by layer. I cannot sleep at night at times just because everything is so irritated. The medicine prescribed to me works but the moment I lay off it because it's done its job it creeps back again, as if the medical cr√®mes are like heroine but you spread it across your skin, even though it makes my skin look like a heroin user's without it.
                <br><br>
                    	The amount of stress I feel on a daily basis does not help in the slightest, I can try to relax but the linguring thoughts in the back of my mind have my scratch my skin open, raise my blood pressure or let me get annoyed with the people that like me. The stress of getting on hormones when I'm a full grown adult, having grown every bone to its maximum potential with my masculine genes. The stress of going to the dentist in a few weeks just for her to scream at me. The stress of raising enough money in time for me to able to fund a new phone. The stress of going away from my current school and going abroad. The stress of never seeing my friends again. The stress of undergoing surgery soon, real soon. All of this just piles on top of one another, no matter how I relaxed I may seem I'm going insane in my mind. I tell myself that there's enough time for all of this in the future but what if it isn't? What if I am indeed too late for my hormone treatments? What if I am too late with work? What if, what if, what if. But on the other hand, what if the medications won't work? What if the medication will just cause me to die sooner, make me feel depressed, cause my insomnia to worsen?
                <br><br>
                    	I am just way too fucking self-centered aren't I? I cannot have a meaningful friendship with someone without me getting worked up about the slightest thing. I can have friendships last months or years but I can magically end it in a day just because I'm not feeling happy, which in turn makes me even more miserable, as if some viscous cycle has grips on me and won't let go until I get a hold of myself. I can't count on my hand how many relationships were just abolished because I wasn't having a good day, some did stay after telling them to literally kill themselves, but most were blocked and then blocked me back.
                <br><br>
                    	Relationships have never done me any good. I guess my current one with an autistic girl is going alright, even though she doesn't see a potential relationship between us, but all my other ones were just horseshit. Imagine spending a week or two with the so called "best girl ever", with the week of her exams smeared within it, where the girl had the worst 'converstation' with her parents ever, with abhorrent screaming at one another, with the paremedics called for rescuing, only to ignore her after those two weeks, ask for 50 bucks a month after and then telling her that you have a new girlfriend 6 months after and asking for the money back that you spent for her out of the, so called, goodness of your own heart. What kind of disgusting, piece of shit trogledyte do you have to be to do that to a girl. You have permanently scarred that girl just because you wanted to have sex but, whoopsies, that didn't pan out too well because she wasn't into anal, whoopsie daisy! Did I almost forget he dumped a guy just to go bang his friend? Absolutely lovely lad, he is.
