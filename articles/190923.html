                <h3>Being transgender is not all sunshine and rainbows.</h3>

                <p>I have now been a transgender for almost 6 years now, while I do feel like more satisfied telling myself I am the opposite sex, others do not feel the same.</p>

                <h4>Fetishists and transgenders</h4>
                <p>I want to make one thing very clear, being transgender is not a fetish. Actual transgenders do not find being transgender something pleasing a majority of the time. Crossdressers, non-transgender ones, find pleasure in dressing up as their opposite sex. Transgenders do it out of a feeling of feeling more complete, not sexual desires. Being AGP is not a part of being transgender. Fetishists have done irepporable harm to transgenders as a whole and if you are a disgusting piece of shit thinking that you are transgender for dressing up like a woman, please kill yourself. Do not think that you and transgenders are the same thing. Especially <i>Drag Queens</i>.
                </p>

                <h4>Crossdressing</h4>
                <p>I have a very feminine way of clothing myself, it is a form of crossdressing. If you are transgender, you might perform this act as well, but while you may find it pleasing, not everyone finds this as pleasing as you might do. People might look onto you in disgust, laughing at you behind your back, or, in my case, in my face. I would be fine with it if it was a), not literal retards doing this and b), not being so obvious about it. I can not do anything about the fact that I enjoy the more feminine side of dressing up as opposed to the masculine side. Having a woman dress up masculine is seen as a cool thing, as a <i>"tomboy"</i>, but vice versa is seen as a disgusting fetish. While it can be a fetish, being transgender is not, and crossdressing is part of it.</p>

                <h4>No peers</h4>
                <p><i>'A fine how do ya do fellow kids'</i> is something I wish I could have in life with other transgenders, if there were any around. The nearest I have as a friend is two cities away, and is definitely not always available if I need some kind of affection or moral support. Having no one nearby to talk to really does make you feel alone in the world against the world, as if the rest of the world is against you. Having any kind of support from a fellow transgender is an entire different world of comfort, but having a friend who knows you are transgender and having him or her as your moral support also just does loads. If you have someone you trust, tell them and talk to them whenever you feel down.</p>

                <h4>Gender Dysphoria</h4>
                <p>One thing that every transgender feels at some point is Gender Dyspohria, a form of thought stemming from doubt of knowing what gender you are. <i>"Am I sure that I should have a penis?"</i>, <i>"Am I actually transgender or do I just think it?"</i>, <i>"I wish I was just born the opposite sex"</i>. It is a perfectly normal way of thought if you are on the transgender spectrum. While I have not had these thought for a long time, it was absolutely awful for the time I did.</p>

                <h4>Jealousy</h4>
                <p>I am sure that in this day and age you have searched other transgenders online. Seeing others look, sound, feel better than you are does give you a feel of jealousy. But the grass is always greener and I am sure that your grass is greener than some other people out there. You should not obsess about other people doing better, especially if you are just starting out, they probably had years of expertise under their belt.</p>

                <h4>Medication</h4>
                <p>I have only recently applied for medication at my local pracitioner. I got the message that the waitlist is a total of 18 fucking months. I will give the advice to, if you are thinking of going on hormones, do it as soon as possible, especially depending on your country's waiting list. But medication is not a be-all-end-all of being transgender. All it will do is give you <i>more</i> female attributes, not turn you female.</p>

                <h4>Dating</h4>
                <p>While sometimes providing more oppertunities, technically, the only people who message you instead of vice versa are the kind of fetishists discussed in the beginning, involuntary cellubates or chasers seeking to have sex with transgenders. It is rare to find someone who likes you beyond you being transgender apart from other transgenders. Masquerading as a normal woman would sometimes be the only way to actually find someone nice, but judging from my lacking of significant other, it was probably not the best of ideas.</p>
