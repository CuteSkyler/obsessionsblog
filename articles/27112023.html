                <h4>
                    Since the turn of the millenium, people have been digitalising all forms of media, have it be music, film or even chats. In this rise of the popular medium to send information through, also known as the internet super highway, people have been missing the old style of ownership of physical goods, which <b>should</b> be making a return!
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Digital ownership has been in discussion for some time now, for as fast as you can own a piece of media, you can lose it just as quickly. It is a rapid process of starting up the server and shutting it down indefinitely. People have rightfully been frightened by this thought, that their entire <a href="https://spotify.com/"><b>Spotify</b></a> playlist(s) would be gone for good at any random point in time when the company feels like it, while physical ownership cannot be like this. The only possiblity of someone taking physical ownership of your physical goods by selling it or by someone literally stealing it, which is a crime, while shutting down servers hosting your purchased content is not illegal in the slightest, which is at least somewhat concerning.
                </p>
                    <br>

                    <br>
                <p>
                    Digital goods, are in fact, cheaper, but are they really? Ever since the digital ownership revolution of the 2000's, phyiscal media has gone down in price drastically by the fact that no one wanted that junk laying around in their house, so as the demand went down so went the price, making it as cheap or even <b>cheaper</b> than digital goods. Beyond this, video games especially, have not gone down in price ever since they were introduced as purely digital media. While the publisher does not have to print a disc, they still charge the same amount as if they do, is that not an insane thought?
