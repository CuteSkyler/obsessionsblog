                    Have you ever enjoyed a niche thing, something which just you and your friends enjoy? Did you hate it if someone came by, wanted to join and did not even try to keep by the rules? Ever got told you are an asshole for trying to keep your enjoyment exclusive to yourself and your friends? You were gatekeeping, something which is absolutely <b>shunned</b> by a general majority of the internet, by which I mean <a href="https://reddit.com">Reddit</a>, the kind of people who feel angry when not being creative enough to create their own enjoyment.
                </p>
