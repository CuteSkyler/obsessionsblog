                                <h5>I need not introduce you to Minecraft; it is quite literally the most popular and lucrative single piece of entertainment media ever. Minecraft has had an arduous and prolonged development cycle, going from a single Swedish guy to a team of friends to these overtly gigantic, massively funded, uninterested, Microsoft's lab-grown programmer-mice. But at popularity at an all time high, is it because the game became better?</h5>

In this rise of the popular medium to send information through, also known as the internet super highway, people have been missing the old style of ownership of physical goods, which should be making a return! </h5>

But also fame about its lack of virusses, its great use for privacy and its high customisablity compared to Windows. Windows also has maintained a dominance over the gaming sector of the operating system market. Due to Windows 11 being not so well regarded in terms of quality in the eyes of the general public, maybe it's finally time for the year of Linux.</h5>
