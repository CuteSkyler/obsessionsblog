                    Should you switch to Linux?

                    Linux has gained quite the reputation over the years, mostly consisting of infamy regarding the difficulity to use it. But also fame about its lack of virusses, its great use for privacy and its high customisablity compared to Windows. Windows also has maintained a dominance over the gaming sector of the operating system market. Due to Windows 11 being not so well regarded in terms of quality in the eyes of the general public, maybe it's finally time for the year of Linux.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    Gaming on Linux, is it viable?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    If there is one thing that has been infamous with Linux is the lack of support for playing games mainly designed for Windows. This is outright false, the support of playing Windows-based games is not only supported but it has been for a long time now. Valve, the creators of the well-known game distribution platform <a href="https://store.steampowered.com">Steam</a>, has been a full-on supporter of the Linux ecosystem by not only making all of their games playable on Linux using their Source Engine but working on Proton, a first-party tool for letting Windows-only-based games work on Linux. Using <a href="https://protondb.com">ProtonDB</a> you can see if your game works using the program in question. As far as I could tell, my entire library works perfectly fine on Linux.
                </p>
                <h4>
                    But what about general purpose use?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    Depending on the distro you use, it can either work perfectly fine for you or you get frustrated at the fact of merely installing it. Using a newbie-friendly distro such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint, it's really easy to get started right away with a perfectly usable desktop. Distro's such as Ubuntu also have an app store to install apps you might want to try akin to the Windows 10 app store, but apps are mainly installed using the terminal and using commands. If you are of the try hard variety you might install Arch Linux because you have heard so much about the elitism of it, do not do it if you are new to Linux and do not even try to think about installing it if you are new to computers at all.
                    <br><br>
                    Bluetooth and other drivers for your graphics card or other devices in your computer are pre-installed in noobie-friendly distro's such as Ubuntu or Linux Mint but have to be installed manually in more robust distro's such as, again, Arch Linux.

                <h4>
                    Lastly, what about creative work?
                </h4>
                <p>
                    One thing that Linux lacking in is the creative sector. Programs such as Photoshop, After Effects, Vegas Pro, Paint.net, et cetera, do not have Linux versions of their programs, which means you will have to use alternatives. Trying to use Wine or Proton will not work since these programs require highly specific programs from Windows.
                    <br><br>
                    For digital photo editing you have GIMP, an alternative to Adobe Photoshop. or if you are a fan of Paint.Net, Pinta. While I do not prefer GIMP, it is a great program to use for general image editing or even professional photo editing. Pinta is a great alternative to Paint.Net if you were really keen on using it on Windows for image editing.
                    <br><br>
                    For video editing, there are not many options, at least not good ones. Kdenlive is cited as being "the best option out there". I do not like any video editing software on Linux, especially because I come from Windows using Vegas Pro, where I am quick to use Vegas Pro's shortcuts and tools.
                    <br><br>
                    What Linux does excell at is 3D programs. Blender has native support for Linux, which is already a great step up in terms of creative work. If you work with Mine-Imator, good news, Mine-Imator now natively supports Linux!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In conclusion, is Linux viable to use for the average person? I would say absolutely. If you have some super specific thing you need to use on Windows, you can always dual boot Windows and Linux. Beyond that, it is perfectly fine to use if you are mostly browsing the internet or playing games on your machine.
